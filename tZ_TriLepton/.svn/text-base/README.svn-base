Submit 

the directory where batch submission scripts are kept. This is made for MSUs tier3 system. 

Open GenerateSubmit.sh - replace all instances of /home/schoenr1/fast2/ztAnalysis with your own directory where you are running. 

--------------

samplefiles

directory containing samplefiles. samplefileN is the main one. When you run_things.sh it will automatically split this into a bunch of samplefiles to be used one file per job. the contents of the samplefile is on each line 

path_to_root_file xsec name_of_sample root_color_for_plot

the plotting code also read this in to group the results and format the plots 

--------------

output

this directory holds the results after job submition but before being put into stacked histograms. 

--------------

histos

This directory holds the stacked histograms in pdf, png, and root format. It alsohas a webpage and a script to generate it.

--------------


bash run_things.sh 

the first line makes sure you are in the correct directory, so edit that as needed. 

runs the analysis. it does not run the histogram maker. The commented out part of run_things.sh does this, but usually i do this seperately because changes only need to be done before or after this point so running them independantly makes more sense. 

root -b Stack.C+ 

to test one job run the following lines 

bash run_one.sh
