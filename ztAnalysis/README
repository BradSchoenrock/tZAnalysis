the samplefile is looking at all root files needs only *el.root and *mu.root

the analysis is empty, needs selection here

the samples in samplefile are pointing to minintuples with only one lepton

samplefile0	MiniNtuples single lepton
samplefile1	some topD3PDs WW leptonic
samplefile2	some topD3PDs WZ leptoning +2 jets

OUT.NTUP_TRUTH.root is ducs fastsim madgraph for zt
